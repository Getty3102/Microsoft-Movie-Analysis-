# Microsoft-Movie-Analysis-

A good businessperson is one who is constantly looking for a market niche to fill or a growing company to invest in. Whatever the reason, investing in a new company involves risk and expense, so for an investor, the true question is always: Is the risk worth taking? Microsoft wants to start a movie studio, but they know very little about the movie business. Therefore, this project does an exploratory data analysis on information from three datasets to assist Microsoft in learning more about the movie industry and determining whether the venture is worthwhile.
